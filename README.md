ZEITreise
=========

Using the ZEIT API, a way to go back in time to see what ZEIT has written about exactly 1/10/20/30 years ago.

I'm a journalist, not a programmer, so don't expect this to be overly well coded. It's an exercise for me to track my progress with #Codeyear.

Help very welcome. Please comment on your code more extensively than you normally would. I need to understand and learn what's going on.
